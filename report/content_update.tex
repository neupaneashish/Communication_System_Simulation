\section{Introduction}
Video is essentially a bunch of still images

Series of images can be processed in various ways to achieve different effects

We will look at the effect of some basic techniques and then a more advanced technique

\section{Background}
Here are some examples

\subsection{Noise Reduction}
Averaging many frames to reduce noise (HDR)

Sources of noise and a theoretical examination of them

STEVEN: ``make some predictions about how many pictures you need to achieve parity with a single long
exposure, etc. I blew through this way too fast in class, so I'd be happy to work with you in more
detail on this.''

\subsection{Moving object removal}
Median filtering to remove objects

Metrics?

\section{Literature Review}
This uses Kalman Filtering to filter out objects\cite{moving_object_removal}.

Kenny's paper?

\section{Implementation}
Extract individual frames from a movie

code snippet?

Example images/videos?
